# Calculator-vacation-project
This is the first project of the Python journey mega project

Do a calculator in Python
and maybe make a web site about it by learning HTML

i want the calculator to do at least the four major operations (addition, subtration, division, multiplication.)

the real challenge that i want from this is making it like a website where you click the things with your mouse
